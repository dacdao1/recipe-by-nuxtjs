# recipes

This is my first time using the nuxt.js framework to build a basic web app. I will upload the github pages here soon. But for now, you can look at the build set up below to run this on your computer. Also download [node.js](www.nodejs.org) to run the following command on your computer.

> Recipe app

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
